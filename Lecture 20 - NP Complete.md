Minimum spanning trees O((n + m) log(n))
All pairs shortest paths O(n^3)

Def: A problem is efficiently solvable if it can be solved inn polynomial time O(n^k)

Preferably practical algorithms should be linear or nlog(n)

**What is P?**
Def P: "Complexity class" if all problems which are efficiently solvable

**What is NP?**
Def NP: class of problems whose solutions can be verified efficiently

Example problem: 3-coloring

Input: Graph G = (V,E)
Solution
