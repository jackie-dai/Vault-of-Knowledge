### Classifications

kinds of classifications
- Binary
- Multiclass
	- many classes
	- image labeling
- Structured Prediction
	- predicting structured objects
	- i.e ChatGPT


**Setup**
Map input vector x to one of the k discrete classes               

**3 Approaches in solving classification**
1. Discriminant functions
	1. direct mapping (SVM)
2. Generative probabilistic models
	1. Model conditional probability and apply bayes rule
	2. i.e. ChatGPT
3. Discriminative probabilistic models
	1. Model conditional probability directly
	2. Ex. Logistic regression

Finding
$$
p(C_1|X) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-w^Tx)}
$$

Sigmoid function *or logistic function*
$$
\frac{1}{1+e^-a}
$$
