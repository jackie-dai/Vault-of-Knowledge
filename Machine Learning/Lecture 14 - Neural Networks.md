## Linear Models

### Higher Dimensions
Each feature adds a extra dimension 
	2 features -> 2D

TODO: proof that data points are sparse (in textbook)

Pros: better at linearly separating
Cons: difficult to manage so much data (10 features -> 10^10 bins)

## Neural Network

### Biological Neuron

![[Pasted image 20251023145042.png]]
Dendrites: collects signals from other neurons
Soma (cell body): sums signals from dendrites and processes
Axon: transmits signals to other cells

Synapses
- excitatory 
- inhibitory

### Artificial Neuron

Summation unit + activation function

**Activation Function**
example: Step function
