## K-means clustering

Input: a collection of data points
Output: K cluster centers and an assignment of each data point to one of the cluster centerse

- means u_k are model parameters of the model that are fit to the data
- K is a hyperparameter which we need to select

Objective: Each data point should be close to its assigned center

**Eucldian Distance Squared
