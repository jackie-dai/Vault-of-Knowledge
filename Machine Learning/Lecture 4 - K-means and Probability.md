## K-means clustering

Input: a collection of data points
Output: K cluster centers and an assignment of each data point to one of the cluster centerse

- means u_k are model parameters of the model that are fit to the data
- K is a hyperparameter which we need to select

Objective: Each data point should be close to its assigned center

## LLyods Algorithm

Llyods algorithm is a k-means algorithm

Steps
1. Compute assignments
2. Update assignments
3. Loop until centers no longer change

insert algorithm

**Choosing the Number of Clusters**
- Using domain understanding
- the elbow method
