## K-means clustering

Input: a collection of data points
Output: K cluster centers and an assignment of each data point to one of the cluster centerse

- means u_k are model parameters of the model that are fit to the data
- K is a hyperparameter which we need to select

Objective: Each data point should be close to its assigned center

**Eucldian Distance Squared

## LLyods Algorithm

Llyods algorithm is a k-means algorithm

Steps
1. Compute assignments
2. Update assignments
3. Loop until centers no longer change

insert algorithm

**Choosing the Number of Clusters**
- Using domain understanding
- the elbow method

## Use case: Using k-mean clustering to recolor images

Choose k=8 colors

Average all colors to 8 average colors to recolor image. This reduces the need for certain inks


## Probability
Probability provides a framework for quantifying and manipulating uncertainty

The probability of an event is 
- Frequentist View: the long-run relative frequency of an event in identical repeated trials
- Bayesian View: is the degree of belief (or plausibility) assigned to it given the availiable information
