## Scanning Network
We are going to scan through the network in patches (receptive fields) and apply a kernel to the patch to convolute it.




image <- convolution <- pooling <- flatten <- feed into classifer/neural network

Convolution
	scanning with a kernal and dot producting with sections of the image

Pooling
	subsampling each feature map 
		examples are max pooling or average pooling

flatten image into ndarray to feed into the neural network
