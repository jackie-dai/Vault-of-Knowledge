## Bernoulli(p)
One trial with probability p and possible values 0 and 1

## Binomial(n, p)
*n* independent Bernoulli(p) trials 
- *n*: number of trials
- p: probability of success for each trial

$$
P(S_n=k)=\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
$$
## Poisson($\mu$)
When n is large and p is small, the chance of k successes in n Bernoulli(p) trials is roughly

$$
P(k)=exp({-\mu\frac{u^k}{k!}})
$$
where $\mu$=np
