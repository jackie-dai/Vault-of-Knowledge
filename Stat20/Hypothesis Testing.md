**Null hypothesis**: assumption that there is no difference or relationship --nothing unusual is happening

There are two types of errors
- Type 1 error (false alarm)
	- Rejecting null when it is true
- Type 2 error (missed detection)
	- Accepting null when it is false
Example

**Context:** A COVID test
Null: The person does not have covid
Type 1: Tests positive for covid when they don't actually have covid
Type 2: Tests negative for covid when they do have covid
