**Null hypothesis**: assumption that there is no difference or relationship --nothing unusual is happening

There are two types of errors
- Type 1 error (false alarm)
	- Rejecting null when it is true
- Type 2 error (missed detection)
	- Accepting null when it is false
Example

**Context:** A COVID test
Null: The person does not have covid
Type 1: Tests positive for covid when they don't actually have covid
Type 2: Tests negative for covid when they do have covid

Significance Level and Power

$\alpha$
The [significance level](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#significance) of an hypothesis test is the chance that the test rejects the [null hypothesis](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#null_hypothesis), on the assumption that the [null hypothesis](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#null_hypothesis) is true. (chance for type 1 error)

$\beta$
The [power](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#power) of an hypothesis test against a particular [alternative hypothesis](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#alternative) is the chance that the test rejects the [null hypothesis](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#null_hypothesis), on the assumption that that [alternative hypothesis](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#alternative) is true. (chance for rejecting the null when the alt is true)
