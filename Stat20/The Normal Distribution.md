## Root-mean-square (RMS)
Follow the steps backwards

arr = [1,3,4,5,7]
Square
$$
1^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^5 + 7^2
$$
Mean
$$
\frac{1^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^5 + 7^2}{5}
$$

Root
$$
\sqrt{\frac{1^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^5 + 7^2}{5}}
$$

How to find the Standard Deviation:

Given a list of numbers: arr = [1,3,4,5,7]

1. Find the average 
2. Calculate deviations from average
3. Apply RMS to deviations to get SD

There are two types of normal tables

1. Cumulative normal table
	1. the z score holds the probability P(X <= z))
2. Normal z table
	1. The z score holds the probability  from the z score to the middle zero

Z tables hold the positive z score. since the normal distribution is symmetric we can calculate the negative z score simply by 1-P(X<=z)



### IQR
The IQR is equal to the **Upper Quartile (75th Percentile)** - **Lower Quartile (25th Percentile)** --in order words the range of the upper and lower quartiles
