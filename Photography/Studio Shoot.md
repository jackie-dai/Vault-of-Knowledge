# Photography Principles: Studio Shoot

### 1. Pre-Shoot Prep

- Confirm shoot concept & moodboard
- Prepare camera bodies + lenses (charged batteries, formatted SD cards)

### 2. Room & Background Setup

- Clear shooting space (remove clutter, tape down cables)
- Set up backdrop (seamless paper, cloth, or set wall)
- Position props or furniture as needed

### 3. Lighting Setup

- Position key light (main source, usually 45¬∞ angle from subject)
- Add fill light or reflector (to soften shadows)
- Set up rim/hair light (optional, separates subject from background)

# üéûÔ∏è¬†Lets Cook

- Experiment with aberrant lighting (unconventional reflections, glow, shadow play)
- Explore composition variety (close-ups, zooms, high/low angles)
- Play with shutter speed to shape how light streaks, trails, or freezes

üé• Camera Techniques

- Slow Shutter (1/5 ‚Äì 1/20s): Motion blur, dreamy reflections.
- Fast Shutter (1/200s +): Crisp light spots, frozen reflections.
- Double Exposure / Drag Shutter: Experiment with multiple light trails on one frame.
- Vary Angles: Shoot low (make subject powerful), high (create distortion),
