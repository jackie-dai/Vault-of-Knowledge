Brainstorming is a skill to be practiced and an activity to be done in a group

Tips:
1. Broaden the problem statement
	Instead of "cup holders for bikers" do "how can bikers avoid spillage of hot liquids while biking?"
2. Write down all ideas mentioned
	this way you track progress and can go back to previous ideas
3. Assign homework prior to brainstorming session
	if you're brainstorming new toys, assign them to go to a toy store and browse or do research online
