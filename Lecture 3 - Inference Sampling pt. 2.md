## Random Sampling
- Random sampling when every unit in the population in the population has the same chance of being in the population. Is this always desirable?
	- Answer: no, not always desirable. Outliers that will skew the data have a low chance of being picked. To sample the population income, billionaires have low chance of being picked
	- Stratified sampling: sample some billionaires and then randomly sample from population


**The estimator is a random variable**
The probability distribution of the estimator is called its sampling distribution, and the standard deviation of the distribution will be called the standard error.
