## Random Sampling
- Random sampling when every unit in the population in the population has the same chance of being in the population. Is this always desirable?
	- Answer: no, not always desirable. Outliers that will skew the data have a low chance of being picked. To sample the population income, billionaires have low chance of being picked
	- Stratified sampling: sample some billionaires and then randomly sample from population


**The estimator is a random variable**
The probability distribution of the estimator is called its sampling distribution, and the standard deviation of the distribution will be called the standard error.

*People like to sample without replacement in real life*

Population parameter: population mean, variance, standard deviation.

## Finite Population Correction 

The accuracy of the estimator is not dependent on the population size, but the sample size.

Given the information, we would prefer low variance, high bias because we can shift and account for the bias.

MSE=$E[(\hat{\theta}-\theta)^2]$
= Bias^2 + variance
