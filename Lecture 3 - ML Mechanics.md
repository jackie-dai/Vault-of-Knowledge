## Classification Problems



### Train-test split
1. shuffle the training data
2. split into two parts
	1. training part (80% of data): train and develop model
	2. testing part (20% of data): test and validate model

### Feature Engineering

We can either **select features** or **encode features**

**One-hot encoding**

**Feature Standardization**
Using the training data to compute the mean and variance of the feature x and then apply the following transformation

to obtain the new feature z with zero mean and unit variance
