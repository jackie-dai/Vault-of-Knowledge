## Lecture 5 - Intro to Cryptography

^3a4e73

Two models of keys
- Symmetric key: Alice and Bob both know the value of the same secret key
- Asymmetric key: Each user has two keys, a secret/private key and a public key


#### Kerckhoff's Principle
The attackers knows all the algorithms we use. They only don't know the secret key/private

**Definitions**
Confidentiality: An attacker cannot read our messages
