Emile Durkheim: religion is an eminently social thing. Religious representations are collective representations that express collective realities. Rites are ways of acting whose purpose is to evoke, maintain, or recreate certain mental states of those groups. In order to prevent dissidence [protest again official policy] , society weighs on its members with all its authority.

The key to religion is not its beliefs but the social rituals that its members perform. Religion is a key to social solidarity, and religious beliefs are important, not in their own right, but as symbols of social groups. The analysis of religion leads us to understand social rituals and the way in which they create both moral feelings and symbolic ideas.  it helps us to explain politics and make political ideologies, and the dynamics of solidarity that make conflicts possible among social groups. The one reality that has all the characteristics that people attribute to the divine is society itself. It has tremendous power over us. Virtually our whole material and symbolic world is given to us from society. God is a symbol of society. Society is the fundamental that religion is built on
