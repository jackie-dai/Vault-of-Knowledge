# Agile Lifecycle with Behavior Driven Design (BDD)

## User Stories
Each story is essentially a feature. For each feature we write a story to briefly explain the purpose and who the feature is made for.

Example
"As a customer, I want to see the top 10 movies sold, listed by price, so that I can buy the cheapest ones first."

## Velocity
At the beginning of a agile lifecycle, the team will sit down and assign points to each user story (many methods to assign points) based on how long difficult the feature is to implement.

Then, at the end of each iteration/spring, they will total the amount of points completed to keep track of the rate at which the team is moving. This allows stakeholders to get a approximate of how long the project will take.
