Divide and conquer
breaking problems down into smaller parts, recursively solving, until we solve the overarching problem.

How to write DP algorithms

1. Define the subproblem
2. identify the base case
3. find the recurrence relation
4. construct the order to solve the subproblems
5. return the final solution
6. solve for the runtime and space complexity
7. prove your algorithm works (with induction or normal justification)

**Time complexity:** runtime = 0 (number of subproblems * time to compute a subproblem)
*Note: runtime per subproblem is not always the same so technique does not always work (i.e. for graph DP problems)*

**Space complexity:**
