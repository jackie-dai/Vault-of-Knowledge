There are two approaches to parametric estimations
- Method of moments
- Maximum likelihood
## Method of Moments Algorithm
1. Find the moments $E[X^k]$
2. Solve for $theta$ in terms of the moments, that is get an expression that looks like $theta = h(u_1, u_2, ..., u_k)$
3. Plug in the sample moments to get $\hat{\theta}$, so we get $\hat{\theta} = h(u_1, u_2, ..., u_k)$
