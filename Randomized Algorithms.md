Two types of randomized algorithms


Las Vegas Algorithm
- They always output the correct answer (output is determinstic)

Monte Carlo
- Thye could be wrong and we talk about the probaility of correctness


Boosting correctness via Repeated Trials

One-sided error

Two-sided error
ALG is correct with probability 1/2 + e
