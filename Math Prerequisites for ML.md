## Linear Algebra

A function f is:

injective -> if A is full **column** rank
surjective -> if A is full **row** rank
bijective -> if A is **full rank/invertible**

*full rank matrices mean all rows and columns are linearly independent, a full rank matrix is invertible*

**Sensitivity of a function**
How much will my output change if I change my input by a small amount

$$
\Delta y = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_1}}(x) * \Delta{x_1}
$$
