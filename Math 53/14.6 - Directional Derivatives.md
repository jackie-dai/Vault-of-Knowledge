Gradients
- f(x,y)
- point
- unit vector direction u


$D_{u}(x, y) = \triangledown f(x, y) * u$


gradient of f(x, y) * unit vector of directional vector


1. take gradient of f(x, y)
2. plug in point to gradient
3. take unit vector
	1. |v| = v / magnitude(v) 

magnitude(v) = sqrt(sum of squares)


*This can be extended to several variables*

$D_{u}(x, y, z, l) = \triangledown f(x, y, z, l) * u$

Maximizing gradient derviative
find u that is the same direction as the directional vector
