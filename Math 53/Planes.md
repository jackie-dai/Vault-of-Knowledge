## Cross product
Take the determinant
	 
Finding the equation of a plane given 3 points
1. Take one point A
2. Create vectors u and v anchored at A
3. Calculate *normal vector*  by taking cross product of u and v
4. Plug into this format
	1. a(x-x1) + b(y-y1) + c(z-z1) = 0
	2. simplify by multiplying out
