## Three Pillars of Engineering 
- Modular
	- Everything is their system that does not rely on other systems
	- This way everything can be pieced together independently
- Editable
	- If a designer can freely move and change everything to their liking without having to ask the developer (it is good)
	- Allows for freedom to experiment and discover new mechanics
- Debuggable 
	- If its modular, you can test it independently
