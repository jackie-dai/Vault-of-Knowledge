$\Omega$ - Sample Space 
Total # of outcomes

4 tosses of a coin
$\Omega = 2^4$

Probability is calculated by:
$$
\mathbb{P} = \frac{
			\text{\# of favorable outcomes}}
			{\text{total \# of outcomes or } \Omega}
$$


Complements

$\bar{A}$ - Complement

two tosses of a coin
$\Omega$  = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
Let A = {HH, TT}
$\bar{A}$ = {HT, TH}


Uniform Distribution

Axioms
- Finest grain - can't be broken down further
- Mutually exclusive - A $\cap$ B = 0 therefore can sum probabilities
- Collectively exhuastive
