## Central Limit Theorem
Within 1 SD of the mean is 65%
Within 2 SD is 95%
Within 3 SD is 99.7%

## Beta
Prior: Beta(r, s)
Posterior: Beta(r+h, n-h+s)

To find the density curve, find the mode (peak of the curve)
$$
Mode=\frac{r-1}{r+s-2}
$$
The parameters r and s
r pulls the curve towards -> 1
	s pulls the curve  towards -> 0
## Poisson
Given a histogram, plug in the the k values (the x values) to find how high each bar should be
$$
P(X=k)=exp(-\mu\frac{u^k}{k!})
$$
