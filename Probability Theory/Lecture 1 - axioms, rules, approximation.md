Def $\omega$ : outcome of one random trial, **element of the outcome space $\Omega$**
Def $\Omega$ : outcome space, contains all possible outcomes $\omega$
Def event: **subset of the outcome space** $\Omega$


## Third Axiom: Addition Rule
We can add *n* mutually exclusive or disjoint events 

It is a bit more complicated if the events are disjoint


### Multiplication Rule

To find the intersection of two events, we need to find the outcomes that lie in the intersection

Drawing without replacement
We have
To find the probability where both events happen 

### Conditional Probability
