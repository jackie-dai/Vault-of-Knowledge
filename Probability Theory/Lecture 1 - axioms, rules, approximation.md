Def $\omega$ : outcome of one random trial, **element of the outcome space $\Omega$**
Def $\Omega$ : outcome space, contains all possible outcomes $\omega$
Def event: **subset of the outcome space** $\Omega$


## Third Axiom: Addition Rule
We can add *n* mutually exclusive or disjoint events 

It is a bit more complicated if the events are disjoint
