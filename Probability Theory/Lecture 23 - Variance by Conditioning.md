Law of total variance
$$
Var[Y]=Var(E[Y|X])+E[Var(Y|X)]
$$

Variance of the conditional expectation
$$
Var(E[Y|X])
$$
*Variability within the individual vertical strip*

Expected conditional variance
$$
E[Var(Y|X)]
$$
*Variability between strips*, measured by the variance of the centers of the strips

Law of total expectation
$$
E(Y) = E[E[Y|X]]
$$
