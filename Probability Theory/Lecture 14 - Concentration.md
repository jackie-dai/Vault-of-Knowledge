### Probability Generating Function (PGF)


## Central Limit Theorem

### Square root law

### Weak law of Large Numbers

As n goes to infinity, the probability of the distance greater than some number goes to 0. We can prove this with Chebyshev's inequality

As for the probability the distance is smaller than some number, it goes to 1.


## Confidence Intervals

**Converting from z to percentile

**Calculating the confidence interval from a population sample**

$$
X_n \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
