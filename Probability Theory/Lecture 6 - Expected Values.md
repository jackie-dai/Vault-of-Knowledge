What is the meaning of a expected value?

- The long run average value across several experiments
- The "center mass" of the distribution
	- Not necessarily the center but the center of where the majority of the data lies

Question: on a distribution is half of the mass to the left and right of the expected value
Answer: False, this is not the median

Example: what is the expected value of a distribution where it is symmetric about x_0?

The expected value would be x_0 because we need to balance the distribution and the masses are symmetrical about x_0 allowing us to balance around x_0

**E(X) when X~Poisson(u)**

TODO: the algebra after plugging in the Poisson formula into the expected value formula

Final answer: u

## Tail Sum Formula


## Geometric
In a sequence of i.i.d Bernoulli trials, we can use the geometric series to find E(X) , where X is the number of trials till the first success

$$
E[X] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}q^k = \frac{1}{1-q} = \frac{1}{p}
$$
where $$q = 1-p$$
