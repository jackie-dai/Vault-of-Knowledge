### Estimation and Prediction problems
Fixed unknown quantity, theta
observe some data
goal: use the data to guess the unknwon

Def: the variance
$$
var(x) = E([Y-u_y]^2)
$$

Def: The standard deviation

$$
SD(Y) = \sqrt{var(Y)}
$$

Interpretation fo the standard deviation
- The spread breadth, width of y's distribtion
- a measure of how "uncertain" I would be aboutthe value of Y, before sampling, how much y varies
