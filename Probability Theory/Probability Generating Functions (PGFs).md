The distribution of the sum of random independent random variables

**Discrete Convolution Formula**
$$
P(X+Y=K) = \sum_{j}P(X=j)P(Y=K-j)
$$

## Weak Law of Large Numbers
For large n, the sample average is within $\epsilon$ of the population mean.


## The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

$$
E(S_n) = np
$$

$$
SD(S_n) = \sqrt{n\sigma}
$$
